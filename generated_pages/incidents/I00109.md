# Incident I00109: Coordinated Facebook Pages Designed to Fund a White Supremacist Agenda

* **Summary:** <i>[In this report EU Disinfo Lab] uncovered a network of 16 French Facebook pages hiding their white nationalist/white supremacist and racist views behind misleading names, calling users to support policemen, firefighters, or armed forces, and sometimes even victims of terrorism. <br><br>This extremist network, called Suavelos, is also very active on other platforms such as Twitter, YouTube, VKontakte, Minds, Telegram, promoting hate speech against non-white populations. This extremist network also organises summer camps for white populations, admitting to the use of a non-for-profit organisation to hide its illegal agenda, which facilitates its ability to be able to collect and redistribute money. <br><br>[EU Disinfo Lab] also uncovered some of their funding sources, from web advertisements on their websites to online shops and donations.</i>
