<td>Plan Objectives</td>
<td>Set clearly defined, measurable, and achievable objectives. Achieving objectives ties execution of tactical tasks to reaching the desired end state. There are four primary considerations: 
- Each desired effect should link directly to one or more objectives 
- The effect should be measurable 
- The objective statement should not specify the way and means of accomplishment 
- The effect should be distinguishable from the objective it supports as a condition for success, not as another objective or task.</td>

<td>Select Channels and Affordances</td>
<td>Selecting platforms and affordances assesses which online or offline platforms and their associated affordances maximize an influence operation’s  ability to reach its target audience. To select the most appropriate platform(s), an operation may  assess the technological affordances including platform algorithms, terms of service, permitted content types, or other attributes that  determine platform usability and accessibility. Selecting platforms includes both choosing platforms on which the operation will publish its own  content and platforms on which the operation will attempt to restrict adversarial content.</td>

<td>Drive Offline Activity</td>
<td>Move incident/campaign from online to offline. Encouraging users to move from the platform on which they initially viewed operation content and engage in the physical information space or offline world. This may include operation-aligned rallies or protests, radio, newspaper, or billboards. An influence  operation may drive to physical forums to diversify its information channels and facilitate spaces where the target audience can engage with both operation content and like-minded individuals offline.  </td>

<td>Persist in the Information Environment</td>
<td>Persist in the Information Space refers to taking measures that allow an operation to maintain its presence and avoid takedown by an external entity. Techniques in Persist in the Information Space help campaigns operate without detection and appear legitimate to the target audience and platform monitoring services. Influence operations on social media often persist online by varying the type of information  assets and platforms used throughout the campaign.</td>

<td>Target Audience Analysis</td>
<td>Identifying and analyzing the target audience examines target audience member locations,  political affiliations, financial situations, and other attributes that an influence operation may incorporate into its messaging strategy. During this tactic, influence operations may also identify  existing similarities and differences between target audience members to unite like groups and  divide opposing groups. Identifying and analyzing target audience members allows influence operations to tailor  operation strategy and content to their analysis. </td>

<td>Develop Narratives</td>
<td>The promotion of beneficial master narratives is perhaps the most effective method for achieving long-term strategic narrative dominance. From a ""whole of society"" perspective the promotion of the society's core master narratives should occupy a central strategic role. From a misinformation campaign / cognitive security perpectve the tactics around master narratives center more precisely on the day-to-day promotion and reinforcement of this messaging. In other words, beneficial, high-coverage master narratives are a central strategic goal and their promotion constitutes an ongoing tactical struggle carried out at a whole-of-society level. Tactically, their promotion covers a broad spectrum of activities both on- and offline.</td>

<td>Establish Social Assets</td>
<td>Establishing information assets generates messaging tools, including social media accounts,  operation personnel, and organizations, including directly and indirectly managed assets. For assets under their direct control, the operation can add,  change, or remove these assets at will.  
Establishing information assets allows an influence operation to promote messaging directly to  the target audience without navigating through external entities. Many online influence operations create or compromise social media accounts as a primary vector of information  dissemination.</td>
