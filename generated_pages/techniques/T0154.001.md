# Technique T0154.001: AI LLM Platform

LLMs can largely automate content production, reducing the overhead in persona creation, and generate culturally appropriate outputs that are less prone to exhibiting conspicuous signs of inauthenticity.<br><br>Some platforms implement protections against misuse of AI by their users. Threat Actors have been observed bypassing these protections using prompt injections, poisoning, jailbreaking, or integrity attacks.
