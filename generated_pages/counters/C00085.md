# Counter C00085: Mute content

* **Summary**: Rate-limit disinformation content.  Reduces its effects, whilst not running afoul of censorship concerns.

Online archives of content (archives of websites, social media profiles, media, copies of published advertisements; or archives of comments attributed to bad actors, as well as anonymized metadata about users who interacted with them and analysis of the effect) is useful for intelligence analysis and public transparency, but will need similar muting or tagging/ shaming as associated with bad actors.
