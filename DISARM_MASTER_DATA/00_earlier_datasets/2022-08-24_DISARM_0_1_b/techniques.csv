Add traditional media players at all levels of credibility and professionalism to this, and the number of potential influencial carriers available for unwitting amplification becomes substantial.

When messaging makes use of factual reporting to promote these adjustments in the narrative space, they are less likely to be dismissed out of hand; when messaging can juxtapose a (factual) truth about current affairs with the (abstract) truth explicated in these narratives, propagandists can undermine or promote them selectively.

(2) An influence operation may create a “strategic new terms” data  void by creating their own terms and publishing information online before promoting their  keyword to the target audience. (3) An influence operation may publish content on “outdated  terms” that have decreased in popularity, capitalizing on most search engines’ preferences for  recency. (4) “Fragmented concepts” data voids separate connections between similar ideas,  isolating segment queries to distinct search engine results.

For example, an  influence operation may use bots to amplify its posts so that the platform’s algorithm recognizes  engagement with operation content and further promotes the content on user timelines.
