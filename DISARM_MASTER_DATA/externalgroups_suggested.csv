We actively seek out groups and accounts that represent opposing viewpoints and apply the same standards of assessment to all content. Our choice of material to fact check is broad, and is based on the following criteria: [Could the material potentially cause real-world harm, if it is inaccurate?; Editorial value: is the topic timely and of public interest?; Reach: how far has the claim travelled? We examine the level of interactions on individual posts, as well as the visibility of the claim across different platforms.; Potential reach: is the information likely to be shared further? We examine how quickly the post is generating interaction and consider whether it may be repeated by others.; Balance of fact vs opinion: is it possible to isolate certain claims from the material?; After we have identified the content we aim to fact-check, we will first identify and summarize the key claims made in the content.; ",Disinformation,,;Fact checking ;,,,,Europe,
