You probably do not think about it, but every time you share a link, write a status or instagram a picture, you tell a little story. About yourself, about your contemporaries, about Sweden. Thanks to the internet, today we tell more stories than ever before. We tell about our world, and thereby we shape it.
Not infrequently, these stories are widely disseminated. A Facebook status that is starting to be shared can suddenly have reached thousands of people, leading to leaflets and hot debates. But since over 4.7 million Swedes have Facebook, texts can be shared tens of thousands of times without ever passing a journalist's feed. And that's a problem. Because when a story about something sensitive or important, something that places itself in the middle of contemporary currents, is read by many people, they often shape their picture of reality after it. Whether it's true.",,,Fact checking,Journalism,,,,Europe,Sweden,,Y,N,,,
