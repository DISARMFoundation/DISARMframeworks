The most simple set of narrative techniques in response would be the construction and promotion of contradictory alternatives centered on denial, deflection, dismissal, counter-charges, excessive standards of proof, bias in prohibition or enforcement, and so on. These competing narratives allow loyalists cover, but are less compelling to opponents and fence-sitters than campaigns built around existing narratives or highly explanatory master narratives. Competing narratives, as such, are especially useful in the \"firehose of misinformation\" approach.",

Prominent examples include the USSR's Operation INFEKTION disinformation campaign run by the KGB in the 1980s to plant the idea that the United States had invented HIV/AIDS as part of a biological weapons research project at Fort Detrick, Maryland. More recently, Fort Detrick featured prominently in a new conspiracy theory narratives around the origins of the COVID-19 outbreak and pandemic. ",

Add traditional media players at all levels of credibility and professionalism to this, and the number of potential influencial carriers available for unwitting amplification becomes substantial. By targeting high-influence people and organizations in all types of media with narratives and content engineered to appeal their emotional or ideological drivers, influence campaigns are able to add perceived credibility to their messaging via saturation and adoption by trusted agents such as celebrities, journalists and local leaders.",

Data voids are hard to detect and relatively harmless until exploited by an entity  aiming to quickly proliferate false or misleading information during a phenomenon that causes a  high number of individuals to query the term or phrase. In the Plan phase, an influence operation  may identify data voids for later exploitation in the operation.  \nA 2019 report by Michael Golebiewski identifies five types of data voids. (1) \u201cBreaking news\u201d  data voids occur when a keyword gains popularity during a short period of time, allowing an  influence operation to publish false content before legitimate news outlets have an opportunity to  publish relevant information. (2) An influence operation may create a \u201cstrategic new terms\u201d data  void by creating their own terms and publishing information online before promoting their  keyword to the target audience. (3) An influence operation may publish content on \u201coutdated  terms\u201d that have decreased in popularity, capitalizing on most search engines\u2019 preferences for  recency. (4) \u201cFragmented concepts\u201d data voids separate connections between similar ideas,  isolating segment queries to distinct search engine results. (5) An influence operation may use  \u201cproblematic queries\u201d that previously resulted in disturbing or inappropriate content to promote  messaging until mainstream media recontextualizes the term.

            "description": "A data void refers to a word or phrase that results in little, manipulative, or low-quality search  engine data. Data voids are hard to detect and relatively harmless until exploited by an entity  aiming to quickly proliferate false or misleading information during a phenomenon that causes a  high number of individuals to query the term or phrase. In the Plan phase, an influence operation  may identify data voids for later exploitation in the operation.  \nA 2019 report by Michael Golebiewski identifies five types of data voids. (1) \u201cBreaking news\u201d  data voids occur when a keyword gains popularity during a short period of time, allowing an  influence operation to publish false content before legitimate news outlets have an opportunity to  publish relevant information. (2) An influence operation may create a \u201cstrategic new terms\u201d data  void by creating their own terms and publishing information online before promoting their  keyword to the target audience. (3) An influence operation may publish content on \u201coutdated  terms\u201d that have decreased in popularity, capitalizing on most search engines\u2019 preferences for  recency. (4) \u201cFragmented concepts\u201d data voids separate connections between similar ideas,  isolating segment queries to distinct search engine results. (5) An influence operation may use  \u201cproblematic queries\u201d that previously resulted in disturbing or inappropriate content to promote  messaging until mainstream media recontextualizes the term.
