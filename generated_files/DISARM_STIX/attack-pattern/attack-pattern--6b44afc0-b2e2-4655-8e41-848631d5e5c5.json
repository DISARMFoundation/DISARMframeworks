A collection of accounts displaying the same behaviour using similar account imagery can indicate the presence of CIB.<br><br> <b>Associated Techniques and Sub-techniques</b><br> <b>T0097.109: Romantic Suitor Persona:</b> Accounts presenting as a romantic suitor may use an attractive person in their account imagery.<br> <b>T0151.017: Dating Platform:</b> Analysts can use this sub-technique for tagging cases where an account has been identified as using a dating platform.",
