Creating a hashtag for an incident can have two important effects: 1. Create a perception of reality around an event. Certainly only \"real\" events would be discussed in a hashtag. After all, the event has a name!, and 2. Publicize the story more widely through trending lists and search behavior. Asset needed to direct/control/manage \"conversation\" connected to launching new incident/campaign with new hashtag for applicable social media sites). ",
