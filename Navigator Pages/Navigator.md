# Navigator Pages

This folder provides the function of storing json files which can be used to pre-generate framework pages in the [DISARM Navigator](https://disarmfoundation.github.io/disarm-navigator/)

The following is a list of json files contained in this folder, with descriptions:

- **1.6update.json:** All new techniques and sub-techniques introduced in the 1.6 framework update
- **fullframework.json:** All framework content with IDs (used to skip the "Create new layer" stage)
